## Synopsis
- Some classes and workflows to connect iRODS to other data services
- directory with experimental scripts highlighting the workflow
- directory with workflow and client implementations

## Requirements

- python 2.7 
- iRods icommands
- iRODS instance
  - iRODS 4.1.10 or 4.2.1
  - Rodsuser 'anonymous' with read rights to /zone/home/public/<repo_name> 

### python packages
patched dataverse-client-python via submodule:

    git submodule update --init --recursive


(see also requirements.txt)
- urllib3
- requests
- lxml
- bleach
- termcolor
- uuid
- python-irodsclient
  
## Features
### iRODS functionality
 - Creation of tickets for anonymous access

### Integration with Dataverse
 - Creating a Dataverse draft with either only metadata or metadata and data
 - Mapping of metadata in iRODS to [Dataverse citation metadata template](Dataverse_metadata_map.md)
 - Creation of Persistent Identifiers with B2HANDLE [TODO]
 - Linking to data in iRODS by Persistent Identifiers or by iRODS Tickets
 - If HTTP endpoint or Davrods endpoint is given, data is made accessible to user davrods and anonymous
 - NOTE: Dataverse offers a nice user interface for data in draft state and already assigns PIDs to drafts, hence we skip that publishing part in the client and leave it to the user.
 
### Integration CKAN
 - Creating a CKAN package containing only metadata
 - Mapping of metadata in iRODS to [CKAN citation metadata template](CKAN-metadata-map.md)
 - Creation of Persistent Identifiers with B2HANDLE [TODO]
 - Linking to data in iRODS by Persistent Identifiers or by iRODS Tickets
 - If HTTP endpoint or Davrods endpoint is given, data is made accessible to user davrods and anonymous
 - NOTE: Metadata is publicly available directly publicly available, i.e. there is no draft phase in CKAN
